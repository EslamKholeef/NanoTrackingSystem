Prerequisites
.NET 8 SDK
Node.js 18+
SQL Server (LocalDB is fine)
Backend Setup

1. Clone and navigate to project
2. Update connection string in API/appsettings.development.json
3. Run database migration (creates tables + seeds data automatically)
4. Start the API
API runs on: https://localhost:7000

Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to Angular app
2. Install dependencies

📋 Business Process Flow
Step 1: Admin Creates Workflow
Admin logs in → Creates "Purchase Approval" workflow:
- Step 1: Employee submits request
- Step 2: Manager approves/rejects  
- Step 3: Finance final approval (with external validation)
- Step 4: Process completed

Step 2: Employee Starts Process
Employee logs in → Starts new process:
- Selects "Purchase Approval" workflow
- System creates process instance
- First step automatically assigned to employee
- Employee receives task in "My Tasks"

Step 3: Process Execution
Task Execution Flow:
- Employee: Submits purchase request details
- System: Auto-assigns to Manager based on role
- Manager: Reviews and approves/rejects
- System: Validates via external API (if required)
- Finance: Final approval based on validation result
- System: Completes process, notifies all parties

Step 4: Real-time Tracking
All users can monitor:
- Dashboard: Shows pending tasks, active processes
- Process List: Real-time status of all workflows
- My Tasks: Personal task queue with actions
- Audit Trail: Complete history of all actions
