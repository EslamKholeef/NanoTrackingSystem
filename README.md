ðŸ“‹ Business Process Flow
Step 1: Admin Creates Workflow
Admin logs in â†’ Creates "Purchase Approval" workflow:
â”œâ”€â”€ Step 1: Employee submits request
â”œâ”€â”€ Step 2: Manager approves/rejects  
â”œâ”€â”€ Step 3: Finance final approval (with external validation)
â””â”€â”€ Step 4: Process completed

Step 2: Employee Starts Process
Employee logs in â†’ Starts new process:
â”œâ”€â”€ Selects "Purchase Approval" workflow
â”œâ”€â”€ System creates process instance
â”œâ”€â”€ First step automatically assigned to employee
â””â”€â”€ Employee receives task in "My Tasks"

Step 3: Process Execution
Task Execution Flow:
â”œâ”€â”€ Employee: Submits purchase request details
â”œâ”€â”€ System: Auto-assigns to Manager based on role
â”œâ”€â”€ Manager: Reviews and approves/rejects
â”œâ”€â”€ System: Validates via external API (if required)
â”œâ”€â”€ Finance: Final approval based on validation result
â””â”€â”€ System: Completes process, notifies all parties

Step 4: Real-time Tracking
All users can monitor:
â”œâ”€â”€ Dashboard: Shows pending tasks, active processes
â”œâ”€â”€ Process List: Real-time status of all workflows
â”œâ”€â”€ My Tasks: Personal task queue with actions
â””â”€â”€ Audit Trail: Complete history of all actions
